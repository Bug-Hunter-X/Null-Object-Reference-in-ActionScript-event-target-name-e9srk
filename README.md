This repository contains a demonstration of a common ActionScript 3 error: Null object reference when attempting to access the name property of the event.target object in an event handler.  The bug.as file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.as provides the corrected version with a null check. This is a crucial practice for robust ActionScript development, preventing unexpected crashes due to null pointer exceptions.
